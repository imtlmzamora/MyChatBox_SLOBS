# MyChatBox_SLOBS
There is my own chatbox as I use it currently in my streams with streamlabs OBS. The idea is to keep the code somewhere I can recover it and get feed back from the comunity

I use the custom option to use my own code in HTML/CSS/JS. Here you will find the code for the 3 areas plus pictures for when i use a custom field.
